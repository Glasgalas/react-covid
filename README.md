This is a small example of using an independent API to get information.

I used fetch to get my COVID-19 disease statistics.

Incoming data in JSON format is parsed into components. And also I use a small
function to break a long number into digits for a more convenient visual design.

Minimal styling is done and the application is adapted to the screen size.
